# django-connectwise

Django app for working with ConnectWise. Defines models (tickets, members, companies, etc.) and callbacks.

As of January 2017, this project is highly volatile. Expect lots of changes.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5 (others may work; we haven't tried)
* Django 1.8+

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:KerkhoffTechnologies/django-connectwise.git
    cd django-connectwise
    python setup.py install

TODO: update this when it's on pypi

## Documentation

TODO

* Uses easy-thumbnails- can use settings from that project to change behaviour http://easy-thumbnails.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/settings/. Also must add to INSTALLED_APPS (I think)
